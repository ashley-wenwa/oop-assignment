# 🐍 Python OOP Assignment

This project demonstrates foundational Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including:

- ✅ Class creation
- ✅ Object instantiation with constructors
- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Encapsulation
- ✅ Polymorphism

---

## 📦 Contents

### `superhero.py`
A custom class representing a superhero with unique attributes and behavior:
- Demonstrates the use of a constructor (`__init__`)
- Includes methods like `introduce()` and `fight_crime()`
- Uses inheritance to extend from a generic `Character` class

### `polymorphism.py`
A program showcasing **polymorphism** using different types of vehicles:
- Each vehicle class defines its own version of the `move()` method
- Example classes: `Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`
- All share a common interface (`move()`), but respond differently

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept        | Example Used                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Class          | `Superhero`, `Vehicle`, `Car`    |
| Object         | `hero1 = Superhero(...)`         |
| Constructor    | `def __init__(...)`              |
| Inheritance    | `class Superhero(Character)`     |
| Polymorphism   | `move()` method used differently |
| Encapsulation  | Private variables (e.g. `__alias`) |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Run each script from the terminal:

```bash
python3 superhero.py
python3 polymorphism.py
```
